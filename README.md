I am Hameez Iqbal, a **Co-op Computer Science** student at **Toronto Metropolitan University**, pursuing a minor in **Cyber Studies** and in **Innovation**.

🌱 I’m currently on a Co-op term

🤔 I am currently exploring how computer science can be applied in the political landscape.

👨🏾‍💻 I am open to Co-op/Internship placements with terms ranging from 4 to 16 months. I am interested in areas including, but not limited to, Software Engineering (with a preference for backend), Product Management, and Project Management.

## Career Summary💻 :

I am currently a Software Engineering Intern at Crewscope, where I work on Python backend development and AI integration to enhance a software platform aimed at improving worker productivity and retention in construction and industrial settings. My role involves designing and implementing backend services, building microservices-based enterprise applications, and integrating AI workflows using APIs. I also contribute to QA processes, automated testing pipelines, and integration with third-party services, as well as assisting with cloud deployment and DevOps tasks. This position allows me to tackle technical challenges, write sustainable code, and thrive in a dynamic startup environment.

During my time at Unity Health Toronto, I worked at St. Michael’s Hospital on a project focused on modernizing the healthcare system through the implementation of a new Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system. My responsibilities included implementing the system on various devices, testing, troubleshooting, and performing minor repairs. I was stationed in the Operating Room, where I provided direct support to nurses, anesthesiologists, surgeons, residents, fellows, clerks, and other staff as an expert on the new software. This high-pressure, fast-paced role involved assisting users with varying levels of technical expertise, ensuring smooth operations and minimal disruptions. Additionally, I contributed to end-user training sessions and collaborated on device setup and maintenance, further developing my technical, problem-solving, and communication skills in a critical healthcare environment.

I used Java, Spring, Angular, and Azure working on both front-end and back-end technologies for the product Consumer Clarity. I collaborated with my peers utilizing Jira, Confluence, Teams, and GitLab. I was a part of the [Digital Main Street](https://digitalmainstreet.ca) and Mastercard's inagural class of [Small Business Cyber and Intelligence Fellowships](https://digitalmainstreet.ca/dms-mastercard-fellowship/). I was featured numerous times on the [social media](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7089355806915133441?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and website.

I was a member of the Data Team for [MPP (Member of Provinical Parliament)](https://www.ola.org/en/members/all/ted-hsu) [Ted Hsu](https://www.tedhsu.ca)'s bid to be the leader of the [Ontario Liberal Party](https://ontarioliberal.ca) in fall 2023.
