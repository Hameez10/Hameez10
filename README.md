I am Hameez Iqbal, a **Co-op Computer Science** student at **Toronto Metropolitan University**, pursuing a minor in **Cyber Studies** and in **Innovation**.

🌱 I’m currently focused on the intersection of AI, public-sector technology, and enterprise engineering, exploring how modern technical systems can improve government operations, service delivery, and large-scale organizational workflows.

🚀 My recent work includes AI deployment automation, workflow orchestration, backend engineering, and AI-driven product development across government, healthcare, and startup environments.

👨🏾‍💻 I am actively seeking Product, Technical Program Management, and Operations roles, where I can combine engineering, AI systems knowledge, and cross-functional leadership to build tools that scale across complex organizations.

## Career Summary💻 :
🇨🇦 At the Government of Canada, I support the deployment, governance, and operational scaling of AI tools across multiple federal branches, combining engineering, product, and technical program management. I manage AI license infrastructure, automate reporting using Python and n8n, improve internal service workflows, and contribute to the design of enterprise AI deployment systems used across the department. My work includes building documentation, dashboards, multilingual (English and French) user workflows, and intake processes that ensure secure, compliant, and efficient adoption of enterprise AI tools within the public sector.

During my time at Crewscope, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern focused on building backend systems, AI automation pipelines, and cross-platform integrations to support industrial workforce management. I developed Python microservices, implemented Django–Bubble data migrations, integrated LLM-powered agents using OpenAI and Claude APIs, and engineered Twilio SMS communication flows via ngrok. In addition to backend development, I contributed to product roadmap planning, QA testing, and vertical market analysis, helping shape the evolution of Crewscope’s AI-augmented platform across construction, manufacturing, and retirement living sectors.

During my time at Unity Health Toronto, I worked at St. Michael’s Hospital on a project focused on modernizing the healthcare system through the implementation of a new Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system. My responsibilities included implementing the system on various devices, testing, troubleshooting, and performing minor repairs. I was stationed in the Operating Room, where I provided direct support to nurses, anesthesiologists, surgeons, residents, fellows, clerks, and other staff as an expert on the new software. This high-pressure, fast-paced role involved assisting users with varying levels of technical expertise, ensuring smooth operations and minimal disruptions. Additionally, I contributed to end-user training sessions and collaborated on device setup and maintenance, further developing my technical, problem-solving, and communication skills in a critical healthcare environment.

🔴🟠 I was a Software Engineer Intern at **[Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.ca/en-ca.html)** 's Cyber & Intelligence unit at [Ethoca](https://www.ethoca.com) during the summer of 2023 where I provided merchants and issuers collaboratively based solutions to combat fraud and reduce charge back. I used Java, Spring, Angular, and Azure working on both front-end and back-end technologies for the product Consumer Clarity. I collaborated with my peers utilizing Jira, Confluence, Teams, and GitLab. I was a part of the [Digital Main Street](https://digitalmainstreet.ca) and Mastercard's inagural class of [Small Business Cyber and Intelligence Fellowships](https://digitalmainstreet.ca/dms-mastercard-fellowship/). I was featured numerous times on the [social media](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7089355806915133441?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and website.

I was a member of the Data Team for [MPP (Member of Provinical Parliament)](https://www.ola.org/en/members/all/ted-hsu) [Ted Hsu](https://www.tedhsu.ca)'s bid to be the leader of the [Ontario Liberal Party](https://ontarioliberal.ca) in fall 2023.
