Hello everyone, welcome to my GitHub!

I am Hameez Iqbal, a computer science student at Toronto Metropolitan University. Check out my [site](https://www.hameeziqbal.ca) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hameez-iqbal/)

I was a Software Engineer Intern at [Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.ca/en-ca.html) 's Cyber & Intelligence unit at [Ethoca](https://www.ethoca.com) during the summer of 2023 where I provided merchants and issuers collaboratively based solutions to combat fraud and reduce charge back. I used Java, Spring, Angular, and Azure working on both front-end and back-end technologies for the product Consumer Clarity. I collaborated with my peers utilizing Jira, Confluence, Teams, and GitLab. I was a part of the [Digital Main Street](https://digitalmainstreet.ca) and Mastercard's inagural class of [Small Business Cyber and Intelligence Fellowships](https://digitalmainstreet.ca/dms-mastercard-fellowship/). I was featured numerous times on the [social media])(https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7089355806915133441?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and website.
