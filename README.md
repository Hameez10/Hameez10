I am Hameez Iqbal, a **Co-op Computer Science** student at **Toronto Metropolitan University**, pursuing a minor in **Cyber Studies** and a concentration in **Software Engineering**.


![alt text][MastercardLogo]

üî¥üü† I was a Software Engineer Intern at **[Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.ca/en-ca.html)** 's Cyber & Intelligence unit at [Ethoca](https://www.ethoca.com) during the summer of 2023 where I provided merchants and issuers collaboratively based solutions to combat fraud and reduce charge back. I used Java, Spring, Angular, and Azure working on both front-end and back-end technologies for the product Consumer Clarity. I collaborated with my peers utilizing Jira, Confluence, Teams, and GitLab. I was a part of the [Digital Main Street](https://digitalmainstreet.ca) and Mastercard's inagural class of [Small Business Cyber and Intelligence Fellowships](https://digitalmainstreet.ca/dms-mastercard-fellowship/). I was featured numerous times on the [social media](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7089355806915133441?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and website.

I was a member of the Data Team for [MPP (Member of Provinical Parliament)](https://www.ola.org/en/members/all/ted-hsu) [Ted Hsu](https://www.tedhsu.ca)'s bid to be the leader of the [Ontario Liberal Party](https://ontarioliberal.ca) in fall 2023.

üå± I‚Äôm currently on a Co-op term

ü§î I am currently exploring how computer science can be applied in the political landscape.

üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª I am open to do Co-op/Internship placements
